# CookIT
Human Computer Interaction - Project in collaboration with Matteo Abbamonte, Daniela de Angelis, Giulia Verga


## Overview and planning
The main activity we chose to observe is the actual preparation of an Italian dish.
We picked as target foreign students who live in university colleges or residences, and in particular we made these decisions:
- Students who live by their own or with roommates: BY THEIR OWN
- Students who want to learn by themselves or by watching someone: BOTH
- All from the same country or not? NO 
- Well-equipped kitchen or not? Do they have everything is necessary or not? NOT NECESSARY
- Do they speak English or not? YES, NECESSARY
- Students who have to follow specific diets due to allergies or religion believes, or not? BOTH, NOT RESTRICTED TO ANY CATEGORY


## Project Description
Our project will address these needs:
1. The main problem foreign students (that is our target) have is identifying an ingredient related to a recipe and distinguishing different kinds of it, since they do not share Italian food culture. So they need a way to wriggle between all these varieties. 
2. Another common problem between all of them is that they usually do the shopping without considering what they will cook the entire week, hence most of the time they need to be guided during the choice of the recipe, according to the ingredients they have at the moment, because they don't know how to mix them by their own.

The goal of the mobile web application that we will develop is to give the users the possibility to shape the research of recipes according to the ingredients they have at home. The procedure of selecting the ingredients will take into consideration the difficulties concerning the ability to distinguish the different varieties of a food product, so that they can better understand how and when these ingredients can be mixed, according to the Italian food culture. This help will be provided through different methods for selecting and identifying the single ingredient: for instance, the user will have the possibility to recognize an ingredient by uploading a photo of it or by filling a guided and simple form.

An example of the ideal situation could be a guy who has, together with other ingredients, a white and fresh kind of cheese in the fridge. During the ingredients listing process he can either insert a photo of it, giving to the system the task to recognize it, or fill a small form with its characteristics in order to identify it.

Based on the characteristics and the insertion process provided, the web application has to be deployed on mobile devices, that have been chosen as the target devices.
